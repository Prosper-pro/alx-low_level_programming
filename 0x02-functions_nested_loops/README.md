This project introduces functions and nested loops in C programming. Each .c file contains a different function while the holberton.h file contains all the function prototypes.

Description of what each file does
0. prints "Holberton"
1. prints the alphabet, in lowercase
2. prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase
3. checks for lowercase character; returns 1 if true and 0 if false
4. checks for alphabetic character; returns 1 if true and 0 if false
5. prints the sign of a number
6. computes the absolute value of an integer
7. prints the last digit of a number
8. prints every minute starting from 00:00 to 23:59
9. prints the 9 times table, starting with 0
10. adds two integers and returns the result
11. prints all natural numbers from n to 98
12. prints the n times table, starting with 0
13. computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024
14. prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2
15. considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4,000,000, this program finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms
16. finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2
